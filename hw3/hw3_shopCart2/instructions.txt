This program extends the earlier "Online shopping cart (Part 1)" program. (Consider first saving your earlier program).

Step 1: Extend the ItemToPurchase class per the following specifications:
Parameterized constructor to assign item name, item description, item price, and item quantity (default values of 0). (1 pt)

Public member functions
SetDescription() mutator & GetDescription() accessor (2 pts)
PrintItemCost() - Outputs the item name followed by the quantity, price, and subtotal
PrintItemDescription() - Outputs the item name and description
Private data members
string itemDescription - Initialized in default constructor to "none"

Ex. of PrintItemCost() output:

Bottled Water 10 @ $1 = $10
Ex. of PrintItemDescription() output:

Bottled Water: Deer Park, 12 oz.


Step 2: Build three new files:
ShoppingCart.h - Class declaration
ShoppingCart.cpp - Class definition
main.cpp - main() function (Note: main()'s functionality differs from the previous program.)
Build the ShoppingCart class with the following specifications.

Default constructor
Parameterized constructor which takes the customer name and date as parameters (1 pt)

Private data members
string customerName - Initialized in default constructor to "none"
string currentDate - Initialized in default constructor to "January 1, 2016"
vector < ItemToPurchase > cartItems

Public member functions
GetCustomerName() accessor (1 pt)
GetDate() accessor (1 pt)

AddItem()
Adds an item to cartItems vector. Has parameter ItemToPurchase. Does not return anything.

RemoveItem()
Removes item from cartItems vector. Has a string (an item's name) parameter. Does not return anything.
If item name cannot be found, output a message: Item not found in cart. Nothing removed.

ModifyItem()
Modifies an item's description, price, and/or quantity. Has parameter ItemToPurchase. Does not return anything.
If item can be found (by name) in cart, check if parameter has default values for description, price, and quantity. If not, modify item in cart.
If item cannot be found (by name) in cart, output a message: Item not found in cart. Nothing modified.

GetNumItemsInCart() (2 pts)
Returns quantity of all items in cart. Has no parameters.

GetCostOfCart() (2 pts)
Determines and returns the total cost of items in cart. Has no parameters.

PrintTotal()
Outputs total of objects in cart.
If cart is empty, output a message: SHOPPING CART IS EMPTY

PrintDescriptions()

If cart is empty, output a message: SHOPPING CART IS EMPTY

Ex. of PrintTotal() output:

John Doe's Shopping Cart - February 1, 2016
Number of Items: 8

Nike Romaleos 2 @ $189 = $378
Chocolate Chips 5 @ $3 = $15
Powerbeats 2 Headphones 1 @ $128 = $128

Ex. of PrintDescriptions() output:

John Doe's Shopping Cart - February 1, 2016

Item Descriptions
Nike Romaleos: Volt color, Weightlifting shoes

Step 3: In main(), prompt the user for a customer's name and today's date. Output the name and date. Create an object of type ShoppingCart. (1 pt)

Ex:

Enter customer's name:
John Doe
Enter today's date:

Step 4: Implement the PrintMenu() function
PrintMenu() (3 pts)
Implement the PrintMenu() function. PrintMenu() has a ShoppingCart parameter, and outputs a menu of options to manipulate the shopping cart. Each option is represented by a single character. Build and output the menu within the function.
If the an invalid character is entered, continue to prompt for a valid choice. Call PrintMenu() in the main() function. Continue to execute the menu until the user enters 'q' to Quit.

Ex:

a - Add item to cart

c - Change item quantity
i - Output items' descriptions
o - Output shopping cart
q - Quit
