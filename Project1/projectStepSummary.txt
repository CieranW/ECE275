Step 1 - Read data

Read in data from a .txt file. Data is in the form of (Timestamp, Distance, Angle) with distance being measured in meters and angle in radians. Maximum distance is 81 meters and default angle is -pi/2. 

Step 2 - Is the data valid?

Classify the data by passing it through a function that reads the data and assigns it a status based on the data meeting the conditions. projectInstruction.txt has the details for determining the validity of the data. 

Data has to be classified before it can be filtered. 

Step 3 - Filter data

Filter the data given a filter width (fixed at 11). 

Filtered value is center of the filtering window. 

Filter only runs when the full window is available. Ie. is the dataset long enough to fit the filter width and be filtered. 

Step 4 - Output data    

Output the data to another file with the following format: (Timestamp, Distance, Angle, Status). Status comes from the classification process.
