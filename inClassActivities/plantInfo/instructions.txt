Given a base Plant class and a derived Flower class, complete main() to create a vector called myGarden. The vector should be able to store objects that belong to the Plant class or the Flower class. Create a function called PrintVector(), that uses the PrintInfo() functions defined in the respective classes and prints each element in myGarden. The program should read plants or flowers from input (ending with -1), add each Plant or Flower to the myGarden vector, and output each element in myGarden using the PrintInfo() function.

Ex. If the input is:

plant Spirea 10
flower Hydrangea 30 false lilac
flower Rose 6 false white
plant Mint 4
-1
the output is:

   Plant name: Spirea
