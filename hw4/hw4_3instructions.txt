A pedometer treats walking 2,000 steps as walking 1 mile. Write a StepsToMiles() function that takes the number of steps as an integer parameter and returns the miles walked as a double. The StepsToMiles() function throws a runtime_error object with the message "Exception: Negative step count entered." when the number of steps is negative. Complete the main() function that reads the number of steps from a user, calls the StepsToMiles() function, and outputs the returned value from the StepsToMiles() function. Use a try-catch block to catch any runtime_error object thrown by the StepsToMiles() function and output the exception message.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved by executing
cout << fixed << setprecision(2); once before all other cout statements.

Ex: If the input of the program is:

5345
the output of the program is:

2.67
Ex: If the input of the program is:

-3850
the output of the program is:

Exception: Negative step count entered.
